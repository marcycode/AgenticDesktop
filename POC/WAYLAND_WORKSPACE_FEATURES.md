# 🚀 Wayland & Workspace Management Features

This update adds comprehensive **Wayland desktop capture support** and **workspace management** functionality to AgenticDesktop!

## 🖥️ Wayland Desktop Capture

### What's New
- **Multiple Wayland screenshot methods**: Automatically tries different tools in order of preference
- **Cross-desktop environment support**: Works with GNOME, KDE, i3/Sway, and others
- **Fallback system**: If one method fails, automatically tries the next

### Supported Tools
The system tries these tools in order:
1. **grim** - Works with wlroots-based compositors (Sway, etc.)
2. **gnome-screenshot** - Native GNOME Wayland support
3. **wl-clipboard** - Clipboard-based capture
4. **wayshot** - Alternative screenshot tool
5. **flameshot** - Cross-platform screenshot tool

### Installation
Run the provided script to install the necessary tools:
```bash
chmod +x install_wayland_tools.sh
./install_wayland_tools.sh
```

Or install manually based on your distribution:

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-screenshot grim wayshot flameshot wl-clipboard
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-screenshot grim wayshot flameshot wl-clipboard-tools
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S gnome-screenshot grim wayshot flameshot wl-clipboard
```

## 🏠 Workspace Management

### Key Features
- **Dedicated Agent Workspace**: Agent executes commands in a separate workspace
- **User Workspace Isolation**: Your workspace remains unchanged during agent operations
- **Live Workspace Streaming**: Watch the agent work in real-time from your workspace
- **Cross-Desktop Environment Support**: Works with GNOME, KDE, i3/Sway

### How It Works

1. **Agent Workspace Creation**
   - Click "🤖 Agent Workspace" button in the web interface
   - Click "Create Workspace" to set up a dedicated workspace for the agent
   - The system automatically finds an empty workspace or creates a new one

2. **Command Execution**
   - When you execute commands, they run in the agent workspace by default
   - You stay in your current workspace while the agent works
   - All agent actions are isolated from your workspace

3. **Live Monitoring**
   - Click "Start Stream" to watch the agent workspace in real-time
   - The agent workspace is captured and streamed back to your browser
   - 5 FPS streaming optimized for workspace monitoring

4. **Workspace Switching**
   - "View Agent": Switch your view to the agent workspace
   - "Back to User": Return to your original workspace
   - Workspace switching works seamlessly across desktop environments

### Supported Desktop Environments

- **GNOME**: Uses `gdbus` for workspace management
- **KDE/Plasma**: Uses `qdbus` with KWin integration
- **i3/Sway**: Uses `i3-msg` for workspace control
- **Generic**: Falls back to `wmctrl` for other window managers

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Start the application: `python app.py`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Click "🤖 Agent Workspace" to open workspace panel
4. Click "Create Workspace" to set up agent workspace
5. Start streaming to monitor agent activity

### Using the Features
1. **Desktop Streaming**: Click "📺 Desktop" to stream your current workspace
2. **Agent Workspace**: Click "🤖 Agent Workspace" to manage the agent's workspace
3. **Command Execution**: Commands automatically execute in the agent workspace
4. **Live Monitoring**: Stream the agent workspace to watch it work

### Workspace Information
The interface shows:
- Current workspace number
- Agent workspace number (if created)
- Desktop environment type
- Display server (Wayland/X11)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Workspace Detection
- **GNOME**: Uses GNOME Shell D-Bus interface
- **KDE**: Uses KWin D-Bus interface  
- **i3/Sway**: Uses i3 IPC protocol
- **Generic**: Uses wmctrl for X11 window managers

### Screenshot Capture
- **Wayland**: Multiple fallback methods for maximum compatibility
- **X11**: Uses mss library for fast capture
- **Optimization**: Images resized to max 1280px width for performance

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks if tools are missing
- Clear error messages with installation instructions
- Automatic recovery from failed operations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Desktop Capture Not Working
1. Install Wayland tools: `./install_wayland_tools.sh`
2. Check which tools are available: `which grim gnome-screenshot wayshot`
3. Test manual screenshot: `gnome-screenshot -f test.png`

### Workspace Switching Issues
1. Verify desktop environment: `echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`
2. Check display server: `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`
3. For i3/Sway: Ensure `i3-msg` is available
4. For GNOME: Ensure GNOME Shell extensions are enabled

### Permission Issues
- Some Wayland compositors require explicit permission for screenshots
- Check your desktop environment's privacy settings
- For GNOME: Go to Settings > Privacy > Screen Sharing

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- **Desktop Streaming**: 10 FPS for responsive user desktop capture
- **Agent Workspace Streaming**: 5 FPS optimized for monitoring
- **Image Optimization**: JPEG compression with quality 85
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Automatic image resizing for performance

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Portal-based screen capture for enhanced Wayland support
- Multi-monitor workspace management
- Workspace layout templates
- Advanced agent workspace configurations
- Integration with virtual workspaces
